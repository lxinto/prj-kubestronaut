What is Ephemeral Storage
    Storage that does not survive restarts.
    Used as required and discarded after use.
    in the context of k8s ephemeral storage is called emptyDir

What is Persistent Storage
    Survives restarts and removal of contianers
    when dynamically provisioning a k8s volume we only create a PVC
    (Persistant Volume Claim) and the actual PV (Persistant Volume) is 
    created against this request, meaning we dont manually create the volumes.

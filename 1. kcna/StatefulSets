The purpose of StatefulSets

    statefulsets are workload api objects used to manage stateful apps. 

The difference/similarities between StatefulSets and Deployments
    deployments are usually stateLESS. this means even if we apply a persistent volume to a deployment
    all the pods in the deployment will share the same data from the PV. 
    StatefulSets on the other hand create sticky sessions with every pod that is the part of StatefulSet, meaning 
    each pod creates its own claim to the StorageClass provider and each has its own data.
